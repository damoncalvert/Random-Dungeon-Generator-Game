     * LEGEND:
     * Blue Heart makes you invincible for 15 seconds and refills health to 5 when over.
     * red hearts give health back equivalent to amount of hearts.
     * Gold attack blast does 1.5 times damage
     * Blue attack does 2 times damage
     * For the life of me, I can not figure out why chests refuse to spawn anything
     * but yeah, they wont, it crashes the game. That was supposed to be a part of my random drop table
     * system but it doesn not want to work for me
     * But, random systems are the map generation (normal distribution), Damage done (by each attack, which isnt possible without
     * chest drops working), and drop tables (which halfway doesn't work without chests working.
